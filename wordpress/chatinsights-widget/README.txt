== Troubleshooting ==

By default, we block access to your bot from any domains other than the one you registered with. This is to ensure that the bot only appears in locations you've authorized. If you are having trouble getting your bot to show up please follow these steps:

1. Login to the [ChatInsights.io Portal](https://portal.chatinsights.io)
1. Navigate to the "Chat Widget" section (the "chat bubble" icon).
1. Review the "Widget Log". Look for entries that have a red 'x' in the "Allowed" column
1. If you wish to allow access from the denied domain, simply click the red 'x' to allow
1. Refresh your site to see if the widget appears

If these steps do not work, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@chatinsights.io">support@chatinsights.io</a> and we'll be happy to help!
